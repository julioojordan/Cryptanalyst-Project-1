# Cryptanalyst-Project-1
<br>
So here is my first cryptanalyst project <br>
i'm using the <b> PLAYFAIR </b> method for the encryption method and 2 methods for the decryption : <br>
<ul> <li><b> Super Encryption Method </b> and </li> <li><b> Subtitution Method </b></li></ul> <br>
<p>So the projet is just random stuff , and i just want to see what is the result of using 2 different methods on cryptography process, i hope it can help you guys to understand more about the 3 methods that have been used Thanks</p>
